# Simple-Cipher-Python

This project has stalled. It was meant as a boredom buster for a weekend, but became a "5 spare minutes" project.

Unfortunately returning to Uni and keeping my job, with the addition of my first child (to be born in the next few weeks) has left me very time poor. 5 minute windows are few and far between. I have every intention of continuing work on this project, and I will be hard pressed to find time to do it.

In terms of features and scope the project is still in it's infancy. Barely a stub. I'm not happy with it and will try to crack on with it whenever I can. No Promises.
